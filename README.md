## Conversion from simple textual input format to GNU Gama XML input

[GNU Gama](https://www.gnu.org/software/gama/) is a free software for adjustment of surveying networks in the local coordinate system, also called coodinate grid. XML format is not easy to edit *manually* and **grid2gkf** is a tool to help users to create a simple record oriented data format with fixed order of parameters (files typically with extension .dat) and convert them to GNU Gama input XML (for historical reasons we use extension .gkf to distinguish them from adjustment output .xml files). This grid textual format is largely compatible with Star*Net input data files.
